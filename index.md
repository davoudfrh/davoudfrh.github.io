## About Me

  I am Davoud Farhangi, a computer engineer who graduated from KIAU. \
  I have a passion for data science and artificial intelligence, \
  and I strive to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in \
  these fields. When I'm not working on coding projects or analyzing \
  data, you can find me indulging in my other hobbies: music and football. \
  I am an electric guitar player, and I love nothing more than strumming out a \
  tune in my free time. I'm also an avid football fan, and I enjoy playing the \
  sport whenever I get the chance.
